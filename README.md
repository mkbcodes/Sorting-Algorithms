# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Java. Each algorithm is accompanied by a brief explanation, its time complexity, and sample usage.

## Algorithms Included:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**
... [and so on]

## Usage:

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own Java file. To test an algorithm, compile and run the respective Java file.

```java
// Example for BubbleSort.java
javac BubbleSort.java
java BubbleSort
